I build systems that scale and solve real problems.

Currently wrapping up my MS in Computer Science at NYU (graduating May 2026) while working as a Graduate Assistant, where I've automated reporting pipelines and built dashboards serving 8,000+ students.

Before grad school, I spent 3+ years at Anheuser-Busch InBev as a Solutions Architect, leading engineering teams across APAC and EMEA. I built enterprise platforms that processed 150M+ financial records, served 5,000+ users globally, and generated over $1.8M in cost savings. Some highlights:
- Account Reconciliation platform handling 150M+ records across 6 regions ($600K savings)
- NPS application with 88 score and 70% response rate, recognized by Bain & Company
- Workspace Management system for 2,000+ employees ($1.2M+ combined savings)

I reduced security vulnerabilities by 73% across 25+ production apps and cut deployment times from 6 hours to 45 minutes using Terraform and Azure DevOps.

Right now, I'm working on projects that excite me: Minto (B2B token airdrop platform on Aptos blockchain) and CareVault (healthcare management platform with AI-powered document analysis).

My stack: Python, JavaScript, React, Flask, Node.js, AWS, Azure, PostgreSQL, Docker, Terraform. I've built everything from RESTful APIs to event-driven architectures to AI-powered tools.

I'm looking for backend/platform engineering roles where I can build systems that matter. If you're working on interesting problems at scale, let's connect.
